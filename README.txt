# Terminal_Spec
Terminal tools for vibrational spectroscopy analysis


Aim:
To collect and make available as many methods of pre-processing and analysing vibrational (infrared & Raman) spectroscopy datasets as possible, using both python and R.

The format that I would like to maintain is one where the files containing each pre-processing step or analysis method is in a seperate file.

Each stage of pre-processing can then be converted into bash shortcuts for the command line.
